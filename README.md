# Next Word Prediction Using LSTM

Language modeling is a cornerstone of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project focuses on next word prediction, where the goal is to predict the most likely next word in a sentence given the preceding context.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are used for this task due to their ability to capture sequential patterns in data. By training on text data, the LSTM model learns linguistic patterns and can generate coherent word suggestions.

## **Key Objectives:**

- **Develop an LSTM Model:** Build and train an LSTM network to predict the next word in a sequence.
- **Preprocessing:** Tokenize and preprocess text data for effective learning.
- **Real-World Application:** Demonstrate the utility of next word prediction in tasks like autocomplete and text generation.
